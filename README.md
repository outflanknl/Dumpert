### Dumpert, an LSASS memory dumper using direct system calls and API unhooking

Recent malware research shows that there is an increase in malware that is using direct system calls to evade user-mode API hooks used by security products.
This tool demonstrates the use of direct System Calls and API unhooking and combine these techniques in a proof of concept code which can be used to create an LSASS memory dump using Cobalt Strike, while not touching disk and evading AV/EDR-monitored user-mode API calls.

More info about the used techniques can be found on the following Blog: 
https://outflank.nl/blog/2019/06/19/red-team-tactics-combining-direct-system-calls-and-srdi-to-bypass-av-edr/

Two versions of the code are included:

An executable and a DLL version. 
The DLL version can be run as follows:

```
rundll32.exe C:\Dumpert\Outflank-Dumpert.dll,Dump
```

Also, an sRDI version of the code is provided, including a Cobalt Strike agressor script.
This script uses shinject to inject the sRDI shellcode version of the dumpert DLL into the current process. 
Then it waits a few seconds for the lsass minidump to finish and finally downloads the minidump file from the victim host.

Compile instructions:

```
This project is written in C and assembly.
You can use Visual Studio to compile it from source.
```
